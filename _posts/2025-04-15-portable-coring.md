When embarking on a geological field trip, the inclusion of a portable coring machine is essential for efficient and effective sample collection (Figure 1). This versatile tool allows geologists to quickly obtain rock samples from various locations, ensuring that they gather high-quality cores that accurately represent their sampling conditions. The machine's mobility means it can access hard-to-reach locations, making it invaluable in diverse terrainsâ€”from coastal areas to remote mountain ranges. By minimizing disturbance to the core, it preserves the sample's integrity, leading to more reliable analyses and interpretations.

Additionally, having a portable coring machine on-site facilitates immediate analysis of collected samples, enabling researchers to adapt their strategies based on preliminary findings. This dynamic approach enhances the overall productivity of the field trip, allowing geologists to make informed decisions in real time. Furthermore, for students and early-career professionals, the opportunity to use such equipment provides crucial hands-on experience, preparing them for future challenges in the field. Ultimately, investing in a portable coring machine not only improves research outcomes but also enriches educational experiences, making it a vital asset for any geological exploration.

## Limitations 

While the portable coring machine offers numerous advantages, it also has limitations. Firstly, its effectiveness can be influenced by the type of rocks being cored; extremely hard rocks may require specialized equipment or longer drilling times. Additionally, the portability of this machine can sometimes compromise its power and depth capabilities compared to larger, stationary models. Another consideration is the need for skilled operators; improper use can lead to equipment damage or poor-quality samples.
