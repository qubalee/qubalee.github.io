Welcome to **ALQUBALEE Notes**, a dedicated web space for sharing insights, perspectives, and discussions related to my geoscience research and educational activities.


My name is **Abdullah Alqubalee**, and I am a geoscientist with a PhD and MSc in Geology and a BSc in Engineering Geology. I have extensive experience in both industry and academia. My expertise spans sedimentology, reservoir characterization, mineral analysis, and digital geosciences. My work focuses on the evaluation of reservoirs, aquifers, geological storage systems, and mineral resources, with the aim of improving their characterization, performance, and sustainable utilization.


**Currently**, my research and professional activities are centered on Digital Geoscience, with a particular emphasis on assessing reservoir quality, enhancing CO₂ storage efficiency, and identifying critical minerals within sedimentary basins. These efforts support data-driven decision-making and contribute to sustainable resource development and energy transition initiatives.
